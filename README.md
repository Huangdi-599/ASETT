# Ayulla Crypto Portfolio Management API
This API allows users to manage their crypto-currency portfolios. It utilizes API calls to coingecko or any other cryptocurrency API to gather data that will be used to implement the necessary functionalities and additional features.

## Features
- User Authentication:
    Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the system
    Password recovery features are available
    Passwords are securely stored and hashed using Django's built-in authentication system
- Referral System:
    Users can invite other users to join the platform using a referral link
    Referral links are tracked, and the referrer receives a bonus when a new user signs up using their link
- Portfolio Management:
    A user can create wallets/portfolios
    Users can add and remove cryptocurrencies to their wallet/porfolio
    Each cryptocurrency has a name, symbol, current price, and quantity which the user can add to their portfolio
    Users can see a detail view of their portfolio, which shows the value of each cryptocurrency in their wallet and the total value of their portfolio
- Crypto Data:
    The homepage shows the 24-hour price and percentage change of the top 10 ranked cryptocurrencies
    It also includes the 24-hour price and percentage change of the currencies in the userâ€™s portfolio
    A search bar is available where users can search for new cryptocurrencies to add to their portfolio
