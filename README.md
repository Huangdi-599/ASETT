# Ayulla Crypto Portfolio Management API
This API allows users to manage their crypto-currency portfolios. It utilizes API calls to coingecko or any other cryptocurrency API to gather data that will be used to implement the necessary functionalities and additional features.

## Features
- User Authentication:
    Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the system
    Password recovery features are available
    Passwords are securely stored and hashed using Django's built-in authentication system
- Referral System:
    Users can invite other users to join the platform using a referral link
    Referral links are tracked, and the referrer receives a bonus when a new user signs up using their link
- Portfolio Management:
    A user can create wallets/portfolios
    Users can add and remove cryptocurrencies to their wallet/porfolio
    Each cryptocurrency has a name, symbol, current price, and quantity which the user can add to their portfolio
    Users can see a detail view of their portfolio, which shows the value of each cryptocurrency in their wallet and the total value of their portfolio
- Crypto Data:
    The homepage shows the 24-hour price and percentage change of the top 10 ranked cryptocurrencies
    It also includes the 24-hour price and percentage change of the currencies in the userâ€™s portfolio
    A search bar is available where users can search for new cryptocurrencies to add to their portfolio

## Testing
This API was built using a TDD approach. Tests were written for each feature before coding began, with a goal of achieving at least 80% test coverage.

## Installation
To run this API locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository
- create a virtual env with `virtualenv env`
- Activate your virtual environment with `./activate`
- Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run database migrations with `python manage.py migrate`
- Start the server with `python manage.py runserver`


## Authentication
To access the API, users must be authenticated with a valid Jwt Token, which can be obtained by registering for an account on the platform. We use Django Simple JWT to handle authentication, which provides JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that can be included in the headers of API requests.

Only authenticated users are allowed to make requests to the API. Each request is processed for the user that made the request, and users can only access data that they own or that is marked as public.

This ensures that user data is kept private and secure, and that each user can only access the data that they are authorized to access.
